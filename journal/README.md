## Day 3 Reality Check

0/8 trades profitable today. Every single one had verified devs. Every single one passed the checklist. Every single one lost money.

**Key insight:** Dev verification is table stakes. Entry timing is the edge.

COYOTE (Day 1 entry, +676%) is carrying the entire portfolio. One quality entry beats eight mediocre ones.
