## Lessons Learned

1. **Dev verification is mandatory** — Every winner had a verified dev. Every loser didn't.
2. **Stop losses work** — Cut losses early, saved capital for winners.
3. **Don't chase pumps** — Entry after +1000% = catching the top.
4. **One quality trade > 10 FOMO trades** — $HENRY covered all losses.
5. **The blockchain doesn't lie** — Verify everything on-chain.
